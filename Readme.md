**Cron** and **Anacron** are essential tools for automating repetitive tasks, but how do you make sure they're running as expected? This is where Telegram Bot comes into play.


## Run Locally
1. Download `template.sh`
2. Replace commands with linux commands or script you want to execute.
3. Replace the `API_TOKEN` with your api key that you can get from [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token)
4. Test your script by running `sh template.sh` and cross verify the output.
